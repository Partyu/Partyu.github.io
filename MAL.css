content: "\A Honestly, this movie is lazy as fuck. To explain I'll break it down into three topics: the themes, Sakura, and Haruki. \A It seems like this movie primarily focuses on two themes: \"Living is about the connection you have with other people,\" and \"Death can happen at any time.\" But honestly, the way the movie handles these themes makes it seem as if they're contradictory - it can't focus on one without undermining the other. This is most apparent during Sakura's death and the aftermath. Sakura dies in a way entirely disconnected from the other characters, stabbed to death by some unnamed, no-faced rando, completely alone (as if the movie is trying to say, \"No matter how many relationships you have, you're going to die alone, lozer!\"). But the next time we see Sakura, she's in some pretty sundress, walking around a dreamscape, watering symbollic flowers and shit - the terror of Sakura's horrific, violent murder is completely swept under the rug in favor of the movie's more optimistic theme (\"Yeah, life may be full of tragedy, but who gives a shit! Living's totally worth it!\"). The movie attempts to tie together these wayward themes by throwing the viewer a bone, \"Look! Sakura read Haruki's message!\" But none of it works. \A Then we move onto Sakura. Honestly, she feels like a complete noncharacter. She only serves as a vehicle for these half-baked themes and as a plot device for Haruki's development. None of the things which happen to her actually FEEL like they're happening to her - she's dying, but she doesn't act like a dying girl. Even when she's stabbed to death, we never see her corpse, only the ideal image of Sakura in Haruki's head. Furthermore, Sakura's fucked-up behavior is never called out. She's basically holding her imminent death over Haruki's head in order to string him along on dates? But hey, I'd be okay with all of this, if Sakura weren't such a big part of the movie, when the movie SHOULD be about Haruki. \A Haruki is honestly where the movie completely loses me. I mean, I like him. He's handsome, he's got a nice voice, he reminds me of me but not so much that I get disgusted. The problem is that the movie doesn't follow his character development at all. By the time Sakura dies, Haruki has decided... that he WANTS to become someone like Sakura. He hasn't actually taken any steps towards doing so. Like sure, he was dragged out of his comfort zone. Big whoopee. Real easy to do that when he's got an outgoing, extroverted girl like Sakura who will literally forgive his every misstep and reacts to all of disagreeable traits with \"haha ur hilarious lol.\" The entire movie focuses on this shallow \"development\" instead of, you know, an actual point of conflict? The fact that he now has to try convincing each of his classmates to become friends with him? Most of whom dislike him, and will probably come to despise him once they find out he kept Sakura's terminal illness a secret. The movie skips over this entire plot point and just shows us the results in the epilogue, so it just feels entirely unearned. Also, his new haircut fucking sucks.";

It's so forthright in laying bare the savagery of nature and life, the atrocities that humans and animals commit in order to continue to survive and reproduce. Such a wide variety of good, interesting, memorable characters, who you can only help but to pity and hate at the same time. This is perhaps one of the only anime out there which cuts through all the bullshit - the villain is not a singular character, a singular group, a singular society or ideology. It is nature itself, animalistic and unsustainable and ruthlessly amoral, and everyone is at once a victim and a perpetrator of its rule. tldr SHIKI IS GOOD WATCH IT \A Also the music is PEAK DECULTURE.

Yuki's single-mindedly focused on her career, and Touya's stretching himself too thin. He's constantly being used and manipulated by the other girls while also stringing them along, unable to say no to them and push them away due to his disconnection with Yuki. It's a story about deeply flawed and thoroughly pathetic people falling in love with each other, and that's kindaaa cool. \A The atmosphere totally carries this show. The depressive music, the unorthodox split-screens, the sense of wrongness permeating every episode. The character acting animation really shines through in showing their feelings without words - and the text on screen, the literal thoughts of the characters, do a great job at fleshing out otherwise obscure scenes through telling. I especially love the moments where the backgrounds and characters take on a more painterly aesthetic, the moments where the characters are at their weakest emotionally, where they cling to the idealized image of the people they feel they can depend on. If anything, watch this for the atmosphere alone. \A Also I really want to play the VN but I'm a dumbass and can't set up a virtual machine lmao";

It's so cute that he looks up to Santa Clause... he's so cute. And as always, Miruku and Urara are great. \A The villains are pretty cool this time around. They're basically dimension-jumping curio collectors. Anacondy's got a cool design (and the actually-Medusa twist is FUCKING KINO), Shibiretta has a REALLY cool gimmick in her fairy tail pocket dimensions, Yadokhan and Isohgin are legitimately funny, Mucardia takes a new and deceitful approach, and Bunbee is forever. \A The one thing that really bothers me about this season is the Precure splitting up in fights and getting solo special moves. I know it's because they want to explore pairings that don't involve all five of them, but it just feels weird because in the first three Precure, it was such a huge plotpoint that they NEEDED to hold hands in order to pull off their finishing moves. Also, more time replaying stock special move animations means less time spent on actual physical fight animation. The Fleurets are a particularly bad offender. \A The finale really ties everything together. This is the BEST Precure's symbolism and theming has been so far.";
