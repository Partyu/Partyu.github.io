content: "\A Eps 1-3 are pretty standard, 4-6 are fantastic, then the show kind of... simmers back down to being merely good. Maybe my expectations were too high after episode 6, which was so good as to remind me of why I love sports anime to begin with. You get a distant glimmer of that spark during Tenno Sho Autumn but the race is noticably dragged out to let it stretch over two episodes and it's lacking in tension and interpersonal drama between Oguri Cap and Tamamo Cross with the latter swallowing up the limelight. Overall I'd say the pacing post-prologue is just way too fast. There's a lot of opportunity to flesh out characters and strategies, but they're almost never taken advantage of. It leads to the anime feeling more like a speedrun rather than a gauntlet, with most races following the same formula of Oguri kansei drifuto aura farming her way to victory. (The lack of depth is probably most apparent with the weird one-off remarks about asheh haired uma musume not being able to race, which only makes sense if you know the historical context. I'm not asking them to add RWBY-style horse girl racism, god forbid, but like. really? we're judging umas on their hair color? imagine sakura chiyono o getting bullied because she has pink hair and there's a stereotype that umas that specifically have pink hair are not fast) \A Kitahara is taking the Leorio route and I miss him. Roppei just doesn't bring the same passion to the show that he did. \A can we talk about the yuri potential though. I need more Belno and March interaction because I don't want either of them to lose at becoming Oguri's gf and an ot3 is the perfect way to fix that!!!!!!! \A also shoutout to ep 8 for making me forget oguri never ran in that race and shout out loud \"SHE WON THE DERBY BY SEVEN LENGTHS??!?!?!?!?\"";

content: "\A why is Nendo in this anime \A Opera is pretty undercooked even in comparison to the other two who are already fairly shallow. Her over-the-top personality feels like it negatively impacts the rest of the show - I guess it's like, each of the three girls has a stand-out character trait, and Opera's being played up solely for laughs reduces the believability of Ayabe's, which really should be a heartwrenching story of the pain of survivor's guilt, but instead is just kind of baffling in the way it's portrayed, and doesn't really click into place until like... the last few minutes of ep4. For as cute as Top Road is, her arc and motivations are pretty basic shit that you can find anywhere else, taking up a ton of screentime to communicate simple ideas, as if she was only made the central character because of her irl race wins. Overall, pretty predictable story, with the lack of connection between each characters' struggles making it hard to become emotionally invested. \A race endings were pretty underwhelming but ep4's race is a delicious taste of what's to come in shin jidai";
