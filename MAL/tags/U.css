content: "\A why is Nendo in this anime \A Opera is pretty undercooked even in comparison to the other two who are already fairly shallow. Her over-the-top personality feels like it negatively impacts the rest of the show - I guess it's like, each of the three girls has a stand-out character trait, and Opera's being played up solely for laughs reduces the believability of Ayabe's, which really should be a heartwrenching story of the pain of survivor's guilt, but instead is just kind of baffling in the way it's portrayed, and doesn't really click into place until like... the last few minutes of ep4. For as cute as Top Road is, her arc and motivations are pretty basic shit that you can find anywhere else, taking up a ton of screentime to communicate simple ideas, as if she was only made the central character because of her irl race wins. Overall, pretty predictable story, with the lack of connection between each characters' struggles making it hard to become emotionally invested. \A race endings were pretty underwhelming but ep4's race is a delicious taste of what's to come in shin jidai";

Seeing the seiyuu try to sell this anime and act excited about is... really... weird........ \A The color pencil effect, while somewhat unique for a super-limited-animation gag anime, looks really artificial and almost generic. I think I prefer the art style of Teekyuu more, but this show has some really good character designs in Sora and Miyako (though Ayako's design is boring). \A Kinako is best girl, I adore her low-pitched voice and off-color remarks. also KINAKO IN A SUIT <3 \A that Teekyuu crossover tho";

The comedic elements just undermine the dramatic elements, they don't work together at all. Haruka, Ren, Natsuki, and Cecil in particular ruined any chance of me liking this show. \A Honestly I kind of stopped paying attention around episode 9 \A I do like the ED dance animation though, and Elements Garden's bgm is great as always";
