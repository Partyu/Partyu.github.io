content: "\A I love my suicidal orphan Nanachi \A It's awesome how this show puts its characters in actual danger. The opening with the splitjaw is great and I was immediately intrigued by the second episode's exposition dump about all the ways they're gonna get fucked if they decide to turn back. The use of the ascending mechanic on distances as short as 10 meters is genius, and I love the way it comes to fruition in episodes 10 and 13, which are absolutely brutal in their depiction of human suffering. \A I enjoy how the lore builds on itself, though it didn't really grab me emotionally until Nanachi's backstory, mostly because I'm not interested in Lyza at all. It's a well-constructed world with tons of weird rules and exceptions, and most importantly feels convincing. I wish we got to see more of what the relics do though, since they are basically the entire reason why half the cave raiders even do this shit, but it is kind of awesome that Riko just up and loses her precious Star Compass like ten minutes into abyss-trawling. The concept of the relics themselves is just standard \"advanced ancient society\" stuff like Okami and Atelier Dusk, and since the show focuses more on how fucked the current society is I didn't really get any interest out of the idea. \A Tbh my least favorite thing about this anime is the background art. The design is fine, but the actual art itself just looks like a bunch of low-size pattern brushes repeating over and over again. They're too noisy and the general style of shading alongside the repeating textures make them look kind of amateurish. I usually end up staring at it through the entire episode, but like, in a bad way. It stands out the most when the characters are moving over them without casting any shadows. I'd rather have low-detail backgrounds that make better use of contrasting light and color rather than this photoshop brush vomit... sometimes less is more, yeah? \A I enjoy the beginning of the series for how much the stakes basically amount to \"I don't want to get in trouble with the director >_<\" and basic kid shit like that. It's kind of cute whenever an anime really captures the feeling of being a child. \A It feels like there's a lot of time spent on Riko and Reg just encountering shit, and while I think their personalities were entertaining enough to carry the narrative of the early show, they're lacking in interest when it comes to just adventuring without any major story relevations or lore drops other than basic ecology. I don't really like the middle stretch of the show in particular, since a lot of its time is spent on that and the Ozen arc which is kind of a slog to get through outside of one intriguing exposition dump. (The realization that it was, in fact, an arc, was bad enough by itself.) \A Words can't describe how happy I am that the Nanachi and Mitty arc actually ends with Mitty getting her painless death. \A If there's one thing I want to see it's Riko teaching Nanachi how to cook as the series progresses \A Love the OP instrumental, not so much the vocals or melody. The ED makes me feel nothing \A Reg is a cute \A would-play-the-minecraft-server/10";

I would have rather the movie put more time into developing it rather than what feels like an endless fight between Reg and Bondrewd with some honestly kind of confusing point-A-to-point-B plot progressions where I must have missed both the \"how\" and the \"why.\" I'm glad about this movie basically being a giant lore and story drop but the scene-by-scene narrative is a little incomprehensible to me and becomes a slog about halfway through. Also I expected more child suffering, what a disappointment :weary: \A Rather than pushing people like Tsukushi away into the dark corners of the internet where they can only write instant-gratification PWP, we should be welcoming them with open arms into our art culture so that they can aim for greater heights and utilize their fetishes to create ambitious works like Made in Abyss!! little boy pee";

Excuse me? \A Note: Momo is 12 years old physically, but since 1 year on Earth = 160 years on Fenarinarsa, she's actually around ~1920 years old. That means she has to wait 1000 years until she's an adult (and it also mean she might've spent up to 800 years in puberty...) \A In episode 45 Momo's transformation pendant gets shot by a gun and she unlocks Ultra Instinct. LOL. And in episode 46, Truck-kun hits her and she dies. LOOOOOOL \A The one thing I like about this show is that it brings back \"one-off\" characters for short cameos or even entire episodes.

It was really nice to see how they had all those same-sex couples chase each other around in the love potion episode without making any big fuss about it. \A Estelle is my anemic waifu. Her episode actually made me feel something \A I like when the music uses weird instruments \A I wish the magic were explained more for the sake of my suspension of disbelief but whatever, I can get that it's not the point of the show. The point is cute witch girls and man, I love big hats \A Honestly a lot of the stories seem pretty half-baked and undercooked. Since the show only spends at most an episode on each scenario, it doesn't really develop them with any complexity. In the end they end up just feeling more like premises than actual narratives. Maybe the LN is better though. \A Also annoyed that Nike is Elaina's mom, feels forced in and just generic af";

From the title alone you can tell exactly what it's going to be, and it never attempts to subvert your expectations. The lack of hard cuts does wonders to communicate the message of the movie, it makes you hold your breath, waiting for something to cut through the tension, but nothing can stop the immovable forward march of the horrific society that has become synonymous with life itself, so all-encompassing and everpresent that nary a person trapped by it can even think of revolution, their lives consumed by the single-minded thought of destruction of an enemy they can't even see, and by the end of the episode, even the viewer, blessed with an outside perspective, can barely muster hope for a better world..... yeah, dark stuff. It's no wonder it doesn't really follow conventions of narrative satisfaction. There are no heroes in this senseless world.";

content: "\A Mononoke with more polish... The art direction of the original ova and tv series really carried them, but this Mononoke was given more time to breathe; rather than having to rely on immediate visual changes, more effort is put into the conveyance of the characters' expressions and movements. Neither does the movie abandon its roots - the quirks of the original are used to great effect. The ebb and flow of the movie, with quiet moments interspersed with fast, loud, almost overstimulating action scenes, combined with this continual motion both in animation and in story, gives it a sense of forward momentum that the original lacked due to its structural constraints. The main duo, Asa and Kame, are drawn with such care and life, their dynamic instantly charming, both of them better together than separate. \A At its heart, Karakasa's story is a simple one, behind all the politics and power plays of a typical royal harem setup. It lacks much of the mystery and foreboding sense of the supernatural that the original brought with every scene, with the reveal being relatively obvious and almost benign. But its strength lies in its simplicity: the actions of the \"cult\" are so very human, one need not look far for an example of the same selfish, dehumanizing, and self-perpetuating structure in the real world, past or present - yet there is power in Asa's resolve and dedication, there is light in Kame's unrelenting personhood, in the way they both break free of the system which threatens to confine them, and find humanity within themselves. In a way, they are Mononoke's most put-together main characters, and the horror comes from that which isn't there - their relationship is ultimately nothing special, but it is still something to be treasured. How many others like them were split apart, trampled - worse yet, by their own design? \A Why an umbrella? I don't really know because my japanese is shit, but you could say Kitagawa turned into an umbrella because she had to be one. A doll, forever posed into holding an umbrella that is no longer there - what becomes of someone when they lose their reason for being, yet must continue to \"be\", to struggle to define oneself in a system that would love nothing more than for you to mold yourself into its strongest example of conformity? Never lose sight of the people that make life more than just waiting to die. \A Btw, the music is banging from start to finish and AsaKame are very gay";
