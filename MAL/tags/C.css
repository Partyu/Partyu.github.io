I don't really care for the characters outside of them, but none of them are like offensively bad, just kinda there. \A the Katana Man arc is kinda slow and I lost interest in it pretty fast \A Ngl the fights are always kind of boring and are always the worst part of whatever arc or episode they show up in, outside of Himeno sacrificing her limbs one by one for Aki (except that one downwards centered shot that was really weird and took me out of it entirely). They always just kinda feel one note and lacking in hype, like I'm being forced to watch some shitty cgi for five minutes instead of getting to know the characters better.";
